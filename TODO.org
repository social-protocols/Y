* Core
** TODO Better statement selection
- Deprioritise already voted upon statements
** TODO Add support to link to existing account on different device
** TODO Delete all personal data
- which personal data? We don't have any?
  - but what about the votes that I have taken. How can I delete them? If we do
    not provide a simple button, we might not conform to european standards and
    get into trouble. A simple deletion of the cookie might suffice though.
